## Running the app

Do this way and everything will be okay.

Step 1: You need `npm` and `node`

Step 2: Pull code from git

Step 3: Run `npm install` to setup all dependencies

Step 4: Run `npm start` to run the app

Step 5: Ready to go

## Project structure

Here is project structure

```
my-app/
  README.md
  node_modules/
  package.json
  public/
    index.html
    favicon.ico
  src/
    actions
    components
    constants
    reducers
    store
    utils
    containers
    index.js
    index.css
  .env
```

If you don't understand Validation and ValidCase, it's ok. It's just my idea.

## Visit my App on gitlab

You can visit my app on this address:

`http://linh273.gitlab.io/nova`

Note*: This gitlab server is free. So, `don't refresh page`, cause get 404 error.

Run app on local is the best way.
